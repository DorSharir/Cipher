Hi, {FNAME} {LNAME}!

    If you did'd make request to change your password, 
that means someone somehow trying to break your account
or somebody accidentally entered your Email.
Please, enter our web-site with your new temporary 
password and change it in settings.

    If you made request, just enter the web-site with 
password, that we'd sent to you. It's after you to change 
it or not to change (We recommend you to change).

Thank you for using our project,
