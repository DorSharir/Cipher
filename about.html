                        In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing 
                        encryption or decryptionâ€”a series of well-defined steps that can be followed 
                        as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is encipherment. To encipher 
                        or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. In common parlance, 
                        "cipher" is synonymous with "code", as they are both a set of steps that encrypt 
                        a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical 
                        cryptography.</p><br>
                    
                    <p>
                        Codes generally substitute different length strings of character in 
                        the output, while ciphers generally substitute the same number of characters 
                        as are input. There are exceptions and some cipher systems may use slightly
                        more, or fewer, characters when output versus the number that were input.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                    Codes operated by substituting according to a large codebook which linked 
                    a random string of characters or numbers to a word or phrase. For example, 
                    "UQJHSE" could be the code for "Proceed to the following coordinates." When 
                    using a cipher the original information is known as plaintext, and the 
                    encrypted form as ciphertext. The ciphertext message contains all the 
                    information of the plaintext message, but is not in a format readable by 
                    a human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                    The operation of a cipher usually depends on a piece of auxiliary 
                    information, called a key (or, in traditional NSA parlance, a cryptovariable). 
                    The encrypting procedure is varied depending on the key, which changes the 
                    detailed operation of the algorithm. A key must be selected before using a 
                    cipher to encrypt a message. Without knowledge of the key, it should be 
                    extremely difficult, if not impossible, to decrypt the resulting ciphertext 
                    into readable plaintext.
